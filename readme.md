Hangman Game (Python CLI Version)

Description

This is a simple **Hangman game** implemented in Python, played directly in the terminal/command prompt.
The player must guess a randomly selected programming-related word by guessing letters or attempting the full word.

 Features/Libraries

* Random word selection from a predefined programming-related list.

* Tracks:

  * Previously guessed letters
  * Remaining chances
* Clean and user-friendly terminal interface
* Option to replay the game after each round



 How the Game Works**

1. The program selects a random word.
2. The number of letters is shown as underscores `_ _ _ _`.
3. You can enter:

   * **A single letter** (e.g., `a`)
   * **A full word guess** (e.g., `python`)
4. You have **6 chances**. A wrong guess reduces a chance.
5. Correct letters are revealed as you guess.
6. You win if:

   * You guess all letters
   * You correctly guess the whole word
7. You lose if all chances run out.
8. After finishing, you can choose to **play again**.

This is a simple educational project.
Feel free to modify or extend the game (e.g., add ASCII art, difficulty levels, more words).

If you'd like, I can also:
✅ Add ASCII hangman drawings
✅ Add difficulty levels
✅ Convert this into a GUI version (Tkinter / PyQt)
✅ Make an advanced version with scores and hints

Just tell me!
